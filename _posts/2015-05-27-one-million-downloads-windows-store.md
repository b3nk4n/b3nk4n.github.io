Last weekend, my apps overall downloads in the Windows Phone store reached the milestone of **one million**.
Honestly speaking, I would never had dreamed of coming even closeâ€¦

_Thank you for 1 million downloads_

This number is composed out of the overal sum of my 20 apps in the Windows Phone store.
I did not include the downloads from the Windows 8 store. But these numbers are negligible anyways.

_Monthly (black) and accumulative (blue) downloads_

Worth mentioning is the fact that my top seven apps contribute 90% of the overall downloads.
