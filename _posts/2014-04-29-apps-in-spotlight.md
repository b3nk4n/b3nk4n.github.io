Each Windows Phone from Telekom comes with a few apps pre-installed. One of them is Spotlight, which recommends
a few apps especially for the German audience every week. By coincidence, I noticed that Telekom is listing
two of my apps in the Spotlight app under the **Top Apps** category.

Translating the short description provided by the Telekom Spotlight authors:

**SpaceScribble**

> Spaciges Gekrakel: Highscore-Shooter im Bleistift-Look

Which means something like _"Spacy scribble: highscore shooter in pencil style"_

**powernAPP**

> Praktischer kleiner Helfer f√ºr kurze Nickerchen

That means _"Practical little helper for short naps"_ in English.

Great to see that not just the Windows Store, but also other app listings recomment my apps.
