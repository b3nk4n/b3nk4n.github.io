You might have heard of the [HERO APPS](http://adduplex.com/Hero) programm by AdDuplex. One a month,
a few apps are distinguished by the AdDuplex network in different categories. While there are also different levels.
A few days ago, my first Windows 10 app [Daily Focus](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9nblggh5xkw9)
received the ROYAL badge, which is the second highest level.
Not bad I would say, because this app was actually just meant for practice.
