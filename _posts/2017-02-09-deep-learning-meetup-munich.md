I could check out another deep learning meetup. This time it was hosted at *Google's Isar Valley* here in Munich.
The three interesting walks were about the following topics:

- **Visual Sentiment Analysis with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks** *(by Dr. Damien Borth, DFKI)*
- **Strategies for AI Deployment** *(by Henrik Klagges, TNG Consulting GmbH)*
- **DGX-1 and SATURNV: The Worldâ€™s Most Efficient Supercomputer for AI and DL** *(by Ralph Hinsche, Nvidia)*

In the third talk of Nvidia, we were also able to hold a test sample of the latest Tesla P100 in our hands,
which is one of the building blocks of Nvidia's deep learning super computers called
[DGX-1](http://www.nvidia.com/object/deep-learning-system.html). This is a nice super toy that every AI-researcher would like
to have under the Christmas tree. Unfortunately, a single device costs more than **100.000 USD**.
