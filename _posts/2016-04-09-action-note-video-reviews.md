I realized there are at least two video reviews of
[Action Note](https://www.wpxbox.com/action-note-integrates-note-taking-action-center-windows-10-mobile/) out there already.
Of couse, I don't want to withhold them from you.

The first video was already released about 3 months ago. Consequently, they have been tested one of the very
early versions of Action Note. Unfortunately, I have to admit the app was not fully stable at that point in time.
However, I still like the video and the comments and feedback the reviewer shared about it.

The second video was just released about a month ago. In contrast to the previous video, it shows it the latest version.
The title of the video is *Best Apps for Windows Phone 8.1 Windows 10 Mobile February 2016*. There are several apps presented
in the video. The review for Action Note starts at [3:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jINEg4EBt8Y&feature=youtu.be&t=3m5s).

Besides these videos, Action Note has also been reviewed already by quite a few renowned Windows related websites such as
