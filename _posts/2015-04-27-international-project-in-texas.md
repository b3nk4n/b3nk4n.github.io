I was lucky enough this year to get accepted to participate in the international project of the Android programming
practicle course of _Technical University of Munich_ in partnership with _Texas A&M University_ in College Station.

Furthermore, as this project was about developing a showcase of a space robot powered by NASA certified hardware
developed by the US team, which however can be controlled using an Android application developed by our German team,
we also had the please to get invited to the _NASA Johnson Space Center_.

After we completed our project work, we had a few days of spare time left to do a short road tip to Dallas, Fort Worth
and Austin. Especially the [Hamilton Pool Preserve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton_Pool_Preserve) has been
an amazing place to see.

But I want to keep myself short here, because a colleague who joined that trip as well wrote a very extensive post named
[8500 Miles by Plane, 1500 Miles by Car -- University Trip to the US](https://m-schwarz.net/blog/2015/04/travelling-to-the-us/)
about our time in Texas already. Please enjoy reading it!
