It's worth checking out the Microsoft TechStudents website from time to time. There, you can find small challenges that can be
more than worth it for indie developers like me.

At the moment for example, there is a competition called
[AppRevolution](http://www.microsoft.com/germany/msdn/academic/windows-8/app-revolution.aspx) with the topic **Live Tile**
for any Windows Phone 8 and Windows 8 game to qualify for it. Submission deadline is the 2nd of May and the app needs to be
publically available in the Windows Store that day.
Fortunately for me, both of my games [VaderpiXX](http://apps.microsoft.com/windows/app/vaderpixx/037acc0b-fdb7-47bf-b19b-f0f99dbef24e)
and [AstropiXX](http://apps.microsoft.com/windows/app/astropixx/f392971a-19c0-4f1d-a71f-eafc193aec88) that I ported to Windows 8
using [MonoGame](https://www.monogame.net/) fulfills all required criteria. Obviously, I'm gonna give it a short.

Thank you very much to my friend _Patrick Mutter_, who is our
[Microsoft Student Partner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Student_Partners) at
_Hochschule Konstanz University of Applied Sciences_ for making me aware of this competition.

**Update 2013/05/22:**

I just got an Email by _Kai JÃ¤ger, Technical Evangelist_ of _Microsoft Germany_ that I won a secondary material prize,
which is a _Microsoft Wedge Touch_ mouse.
