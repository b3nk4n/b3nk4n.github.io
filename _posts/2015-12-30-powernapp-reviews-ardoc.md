[ARdoc](http://www.ifi.uzh.ch/seal/people/panichella/tools/ARdoc.html) is a tool developed by students of
[University of Zurich](https://www.uzh.ch/cmsssl/en.html) for automated analysis of app store reviews.

> A Java tool to automatically recognize natural language fragments in user reviews that are relevant for developers
> to evolve their applications.

It processes and classifies reviews in natural language and generated aggregated summaries. These contain for example
potential feature requests, reported issues or frequently asked questions. The latter could for example indicate
that your app might not be fully intuitive to users.

It is to mention that my app [powernAPP](https://www.microsoft.com/de-de/p/powernapp/9wzdncrdmxlv#activetab=pivot:overviewtab)
played an supporting role in the published whitepaper with the title *ARdoc: App Reviews Development Oriented Classifier*
([PDF](https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/125316/1/paper.pdf)). The many reviews of powernAPP served as test data for the
proposed ARdoc system. If you take a closer look at the published [video](https://youtu.be/fyMfi_0IJAs),
then you might notice that the shown reviews are from my app. Last but not least, they mentioned me in the acknowledgment section
of the paper.

Personally, I think such a tool could be very helpful for (indie) app developers like me. In the meantime, I have 22 apps
in the Windows Store. In total, I receive around 10 to 100 Reviews each single day. Therefore, without any sort of automation,
it is almost impossible to read and respect each of them individually.
