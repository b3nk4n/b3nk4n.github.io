Recently, I received a message from a Swiss magazine that is specialized for topics around mobile apps and devices,
whether I would be interested to participate in a developer interview with them. Of couse, I did not decline this request.
You can now find the interview on the
[PocketPC website](http://www.pocketpc.ch/magazin/testberichte/pocketpc-ch-interview-der-entwickler-von-foto-info-6000/).
