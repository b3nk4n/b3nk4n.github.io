My apps and games in the Windows Phone store reached a first milestone of **100,000** downloads.

_100k downloads in Windows Phone store_

The peaks in the chart above before 2013 are easy to explain. Whenever a new app was released, this app was then listed
in the **New Releases** (_"Neu und Angesagt"_ in German) section of the Windows Phone store at the very top.
However, such a peak is not visible for [ScribbleHunter](http://www.windowsphone.com/s?appid=ed250596-e670-4d22-aee1-8ed0a08c411f)
which was released on April 2013. It looks like the previous naive ranking algorithm of listed any new app at the very front
got changed in the meantime. Honestly speaking, that was just a matter of time.

The following table lists the detailed number of downloads for each app.

| App / Game         | Total downloads |
|:-------------------|----------------:|
| SpaceScribble      | 50,810          |
| AstropiXX          | 29,454          |
| SpacepiXX          | 17,071          |
| ScribbleHunter     | 3,009           |
| VaderpiXX          | 2,514           |
