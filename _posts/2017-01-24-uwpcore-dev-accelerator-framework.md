Since it has proven stability and reliability in two successful Windows 10 project for more than a year, 
we thought about to open source our service-driven framework. Even when it has not reached version 1.0 yet,
you can nevertheless use it for your next project right now.
Check out the [UWPCore Framework on Github](https://github.com/b3nk4n/uwpcore.framework). 
I developed this framework in course of the last year together with my friend Patrick Mutter.

It even includes a short description of how to get started. In case you use our framework, 
and consider any kind of problem or bug, feel free to either open an issue on Github,
or via a pull request.
