With a little bit of luck, we ended up with 3 free tickets for CeBIT 2013 sponsored by our university in Constance.
We spent an entire weekend there and had planty of time to check out everything this gigantic exhibition had to offer.

We have seen so many things that it is hard to write about everything here. I will therefore just add a few pictures
to share some impressions of it.

On our way back, we stopped for one night in Frankfurt. It was my first time ever in that city. And we took the chance
to enjoy the view from the highest viewing point at [Main Tower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Tower).
