Yesterday, together with some friends we drove to Biblisthal in Switzerland to hike the
[Ortstock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ortstock) peak, which is located at an elevation of 2,717 m (or 8,914 ft)
on the border between the cantons of Schwyz and Glarus. Due to the sunny weekend weather, it was not really hard to get the
motiviation need for this. And what started as a slow-paced hike ended up in a strenuous effort.

This was honestly my first hike in the [Swiss Alps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_Alps).
And it was a really amazing experience. Spending some time in such an idyllic and untouched nature
really helps to free your mind.
