A passionate technology enthusiast who enjoys dealing with various challenges in the field of Software Engineering,
Game Development and Machine Learning, well balanced with outdoor activities, healthy food and a good social life
with family and friends. In both my professional career, I'm creating software such as large scale cloud native
microservice applications in the domain of observability, automated monitoring and alerting such as AIOps.
In my free time, I love to work on mobile apps or 2D retro games running on different platforms that are used
by a large number of end-users. Lately, I started to work on online multiplayer games to make the time during the pendamic
with friends more enjoyable.

What excites me about writing software is that sky's literally the limit thanks to open source: you have free access
to kind of everything you need, and the only tool required is your computer that you have anyways.
In the end, the only limit is your time and creativity.

## My Values

- **Selflessness:** Think outside of the scope of your team, and especially yourself. And always focus on the overall value that we all create. All teams (should) work towards a common goal. As an example, the end-user does not care **who** built it, or who got the **credit** for it behind the scenes.
- **Communication:** Honest and transparent communication is key, especially when working in a larger, international team.
- **Passion:** You spend almost most of time at work; so better enjoy it and make it to your passion! Be excited about the challenges at work, and be proud of your achievements, or when you learn from mistakes.
- **Learning**: Always keep a (e)book (or PDF on your phone) at hand for whenever you have a few free minutes. It's astonishing how much you can learn within a year just by filling these gaps and using your time efficiently. Furthermore, acknowledge that there are always more experience people out there to learn from.
- **Inclusion:** Everyone is different. Treat them with respect. And collaborate with them openly, instead of being narrow minded. Share knowledge, and accept to learn from their experience. There is always a chance that you might be wrong.
- **Fail Fast:** Don't shy away to take a risk, and follow the Pareto's Principle to gain early feedback. If things don't work out, pivot and change your plans or strategy. Nobody should be judged for trying to be innovative. Or to learn from failure. It's essential to gain experience.
- **Farsigtedness:** Make data-driven decisions that aim for long-term success, instead of just fulfilling short-term expectations. 
- **Contentment:** The best things in life are free.
